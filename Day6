Compiler and JVM Activities:
============================

Compiler Responsibilities:
==========================
1. Compiler is translation software. It is responsible to convert source code to bytecode in JVM 
  understandable way.

2. Compiler takes .java files name as Input. It searches the .java file in PWD (Present Working Directory) with
  the given name Example.java

3. If not found, it throws error: file not found
	D:\>CJ\javac A.java
	error: file not found A.java

4. If .java file is found, it reads entire code from first line to last line availble in this .java file

5. Then verifies the syntax of each line for correctly written or not

6. If there is any syntax mistake compiler throws error, and terminates compilation and .class file is not
  generated.

7. If there are no syntax mistakes, compiler translates entire source code to byte code and save it in 
  new file with the extension .class and with classname as its name.
		D:\CJ\>javac Example.java
			|-> FirstProgram.class

JVM Responsibilities:
=====================

1. The JVM is a Java Platform or Translation software. It is responsible for running 
   Java bytecode by converting them into current OS machine language code.

2. JVM takes classname as input and searches .class file with given class name as FirstProgram.class in PWD

3. If .class is not found, JVM throws error 
	D:\CJ\>java A
		Error: Could not find or load main class A
		Caused by: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: A

4. If .class is find, JVM searches main method in this class

5. If main method is not found, JVM throws error
	Error: Main method not found in class FirstProgram, 
	please define the main method as:
   		public static void main(String[] args)

6. If main method is found, JVM starts execution and displays output as per the logic available in main method
	D:\CJ\>java FirstProgram
		|-> MCProgrammingWorld!

7. During execution if there are any logical errors, 
   JVM terminates program execution abnormally by throwing error, 
   Abnormal termination means, the statements placed before error lines are executed,
   the statements places after error line are not executed.
